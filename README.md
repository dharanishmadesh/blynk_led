## **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps**  

1. **Install Libraries:**  
   Install the ESP8266 board and required libraries in the Arduino IDE.  

2. **Update Code:**  
   Open the `ESP8266_LED_Blynk.ino` file and replace the placeholders with:  
   - **`auth`**: Your Blynk authentication token.  
   - **`ssid`**: Your Wi-Fi network name.  
   - **`pass`**: Your Wi-Fi password.  

3. **Set Up Blynk App:**  
   - Download and install the Blynk app.  
   - Create a new project and add:  
     - A **Button Widget** for toggling the LED.  
     - A **Slider Widget** for brightness control (if applicable).  
   - Assign the widgets to the correct virtual pins (e.g., V1 for Button).  

4. **Upload Code:**  
   Upload the modified code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.

## **üí° Code Example**  

Refer to the `ESP8266_LED_Blynk.ino` file for the full implementation. Here's a snippet:  

```cpp  
#define BLYNK_PRINT Serial  
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>  
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h>  

char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";  
char ssid[] = "YourSSID";  
char pass[] = "YourPassword";  

void setup() {  
  Serial.begin(9600);  
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);  
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);  
}  

void loop() {  
  Blynk.run();  
}  
```
